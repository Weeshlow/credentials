A package to simplify gathering credentials from a user.

## Use

The best way to ask for user credentials depends on the way in which the user is running R.
For example, `readline` with hidden input works fine for users working in a terminal, but users of RStudio will have better luck using the RStudio API or a mini Shiny app.
This package provides a layer of abstraction between package authors needing to collect credentials and user who have different preferences about how to use R.
The package will interrogate the users R session to determine the best approach for collecting credentials, do the collection, and return the result to the caller in a consistent list structure.

## Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}       
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mitre/credentials")
```
