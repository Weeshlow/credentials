Title: Asks for credentials without exposing plain text passwords
Version: 0.0.1

Description: This package asks for passwords without exposing passwords as plain text.
             The advantage of using this package in lieu of a direct passwork asking approach
             is that the R process is interrogated to determine which method of collecting
             credentials will work best.
